                <h3> Traditional Research Paper Example: Digital Storytelling Practices for Cultivating
                    Empathy in Children for E-Learning Purposes </h3>
                <p>Digital storytelling is the practice of showing stories with different types of media. It can be used
                    for educational purposes for teaching children new concepts and encouraging them to
                    participate in digital conversations. Indeed, children can actively become involved in their own
                    learning process, cognitive development can be fostered, and collaborative teaching practices
                    can be enhanced significantly. Within the learning process, empathy is an essential component
                    that allows children to share their perspectives linked to their personal identity. Empathy fosters
                    emotional intelligence, and through stories, children can promote compassion and solidarity.
                    This Major Research Paper proposes a digital storytelling model where empathy is integrated
                    into the learning process for changing children's learning outcomes. A digital story was created
                    to encourage children to interact with the narrative and understand other perspectives. Digital
                    storytelling may help bolster empathy in children's learning experiences and expand their
                    knowledge through a collaborative path.</p>

                    crowdsources information on place accessibility. Recently, AccessNow launched an initiative in
                    response to COVID-19. Maayan created AccessNow as a startup for her MRP project, and it is
                    now a fully flagged company with government-funded programming.</p>
