            <p>For Fall 2025: The first consideration deadline for Domestic and International is January 20th, 2025. Admissions results for September 2025 first consideration will be shared with applicants by February 28, 2025. Admission results for any applications submitted after the first consideration deadline will take 6-8 weeks for admission results due to the high volume of applications</p>
            <br>
            <p>The International deadline is set considering study permit application timelines, with the goal to avoid possible issues in admission due to student permit delays.

            We encourage all applicants to apply sooner rather than later as we view applications on a rolling basis.

            All application date statuses and first consideration dates will be updated through the Graduate Studies' webpage.</p>
